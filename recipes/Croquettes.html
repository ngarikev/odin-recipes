    <h2>What Is a Croquette?</h2>
    <p>
        The word croquette is derived from the French word croquer,
         meaning “to crunch.” The origin of the dish is hard to pinpoint,
          perhaps because there are versions of these breaded, 
          deep-fried “dumplings” all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter where in the world you are,
         a croquette is simply a main ingredient
          (typically meat or vegetables) bound together and then shaped,
           breaded, and deep-fried.
            They’re generally served as an appetizer or snack food.
